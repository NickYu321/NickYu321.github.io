About Me
======
I want to be a full stack robotic engineer. I am currently learning Robot localization and mapping, Multivariable linear control, and FEA algorithms. Working on projects of visual relocalization and a digging robot using sensor fusion (EKF). My previous projects focused on e-VTOL and BWB aircraftâ€™s structure and aerodynamics design, I also have some experience in 6 DOF robotics arm, bio-hybrid soft robotics. I am comfortable working on electronic design and coding in C/C++, Python and Matlab.

I will graduate from my Master of science in Mechanical Engineering in May 2025. I am currently looking for 2024 summer internship.

I have TA experience in fluid dynamics and mechanical design, which means that I have a strong background in traditional mechanical engineering fields. I am also improving my coding skills here at CMU pretty fast by taking courses like Computer Systems, AI and ML, and SLAM.
