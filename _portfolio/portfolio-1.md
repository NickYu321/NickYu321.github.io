**<span style="font-size:larger;">Introduction:</span>**

    Our project revolves around the development of an electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (e-VTOL) drone, combining advanced control systems, aerodynamic optimization, and innovative construction techniques. By leveraging experimental data and cutting-edge technology, we aimed to create a versatile drone capable of seamless transitions between vertical and horizontal flight modes.

**<span style="font-size:larger;">Objective:</span>**

  The primary objective of our project was to design and construct an e-VTOL drone that excels in stability, efficiency, and performance. Through a multidisciplinary approach encompassing aerodynamics, control systems, and structural engineering, we aimed to push the boundaries of drone technology and pave the way for future innovations.

**<span style="font-size:larger;">Description:</span>**

Our project comprised several key components and achievements:

• Gyroscopic Attitude Control: Implemented gyroscopic control systems to stabilize the aircraft during vertical take-off and landing, seamlessly transitioning to horizontal flight for efficient navigation.

• Aerodynamic Optimization: Utilized experimental data to calculate and select optimal airfoils, significantly reducing wing weight by 50% through precise 3D printing using light-PLA material.

• Structural Engineering: Constructed the body structure using a combination of laser cutting and 3D printing techniques, employing Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methods and experimental testing to enhance structural strength and durability.

• Electrical Systems Design: Designed and assembled circuits utilizing components such as Teensy 4.0, servos, brushless motors, ESCs, gyroscopes, radio receivers, and batteries. Ensured proper integration within the body structure while balancing the center of mass for optimal flight dynamics.

• Drone Club Establishment: Established and launched a drone club at our school, providing an enduring platform for students to collaborate, innovate, and contribute to ongoing projects. This initiative aimed to foster a community of drone enthusiasts and facilitate knowledge sharing and skill development.
