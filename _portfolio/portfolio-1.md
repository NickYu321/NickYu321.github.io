• Stabilized the aircraft with gyroscopic control of its attitude during vertical take-off and landing, switched from vertical takeoff & landing to horizontal flying
• Utilized calculations and airfoil selection based on experimental data, produced precise wings via light-PLA 3D printing to reduce 50% of wing weight and normal 3D printing wings
• Built body structure with laser cut and 3D printing, use FEA methods and experimental methods to test and
improve structure strength
• Designed and constructed circuits using teensy 4.0, servos, brushless motors, ESCs, Gyro, radio receiver, and
batteries. Designed body structure to accommodate circuits and balanced the center of mass
• Established and launched a drone club at school, established an enduring platform for new members to build
upon and enhance the ongoing project
