• Optimized and 3d-printed soft robot scaffolds using PEDGA
• Fabricated muscle actuators through cellular differentiation and maturation
• Performed the movement of biohybrid walkers operating optical and electrical signals, the motion of the walker
was analyzed in Tracker and MATLAB from simulation videos
• Published a journal as fourth Author: Wang J, Wang Y, Kim Y, Yu T, Bashir R. 'Multi-actuator light-controlled
biological robots.' APL Bioengineering. (Aug 2022)
