<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></span>

  Our project focuses on the development of multi-actuator bio-hybrid walkers, integrating soft robotics, cellular engineering, and advanced control systems. By leveraging cutting-edge materials and techniques, we aimed to create versatile and adaptive walkers capable of complex movements and interactions with their environment.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Objective:</strong></span>

  The primary objective of our project was to design, fabricate, and analyze multi-actuator bio-hybrid walkers that exhibit responsive and controllable locomotion. Through a combination of soft robotics scaffolds, muscle actuators, and sophisticated control mechanisms, we sought to push the boundaries of bio-inspired robotics and pave the way for future applications in fields such as healthcare and exploration.

Our project comprised several key components and achievements:

• Soft Robot Scaffold Optimization: Utilized PEDGA (Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate) to optimize and 3D print soft robot scaffolds, ensuring flexibility, durability, and biocompatibility.

• Muscle Actuator Fabrication: Employed cellular differentiation and maturation techniques to fabricate muscle actuators capable of responsive and dynamic movements.

• Control System Implementation: Orchestrated the movement of bio-hybrid walkers using optical and electrical signals, enabling precise control and coordination of multiple actuators. Analyzed the motion of the walkers through simulation videos processed in Tracker and MATLAB.
