• Optimized and 3d-printed soft robot scaffolds using PEDGA

<br/><img src='/images/BiohybridWalkers2.png'>

• Fabricated muscle actuators through cellular differentiation and maturation

• Performed the movement of biohybrid walkers operating optical and electrical signals, the motion of the walker
was analyzed in Tracker and MATLAB from simulation videos
