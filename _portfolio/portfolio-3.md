<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></span>

  Our project aims to develop a rope climbing robot capable of traversing along a horizontal rope efficiently. This innovative robot integrates mechanical and electrical components, emphasizing linkage design for optimal performance. By creating a compact body housing all electronics internally, we have focused on achieving both functionality and aesthetics.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Description:</strong></span>

  The rope climbing robot features a compact body housing all electronic components within its structure. Utilizing a single DC motor and gearbox, rotational motion is transmitted to two four-bar linkages, representing the robot's hands. Additionally, a tail mechanism has been incorporated to enhance stability during high-speed forward movements. In this project I designed the body structure of the robot and come up with the tail design.
