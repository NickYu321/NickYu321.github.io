<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Introduction:</strong></span>

  Our project focuses on the development of a blended-wing-body drone, incorporating advanced aerodynamic principles and innovative design techniques. Through a series of systematic experiments and iterative design processes, we aimed to optimize the drone's performance and feasibility.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Objective:</strong></span>

  The primary objective of our project was to evaluate the aerodynamic characteristics of our blended-wing-body drone design and validate its feasibility through practical testing. Additionally, we aimed to explore the potential of using 3D printing technology for rapid prototyping and design iteration.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><strong>Description:</strong></span>

  In collaboration with my team and under the guidance of our professor, I conducted experiments in a wind tunnel to measure the lift and aerodynamic center of our drone. With the support of our professor, we explored the feasibility of using a 3D printed aircraft for initial testing before transitioning to carbon fiber construction.

The design process involved several key steps:

• Aerodynamic Center Positioning: Using data from wind tunnel tests, I optimized the positioning of the drone's motor and battery to achieve optimal aerodynamic performance in horizontal flight.

• 3D Printing Optimization: I conducted tests to determine the fill rate and wall thickness achievable with our FDM printer, ensuring compatibility with drone construction requirements.

• Structural Reinforcement: To enhance the strength and durability of the 3D printed components, carbon rods were strategically added to connect and reinforce individual body sections.

• Flight Testing: The final assembled drone underwent successful flight tests, demonstrating its capability to fly short distances. However, limitations were identified with the use of FDM printed PLA material due to its inability to meet the lightweight and strength requirements of aircraft construction.
